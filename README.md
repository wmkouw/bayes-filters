# Bayesian filters

Standard Kalman filters:

- Kalman filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))
- Extended Kalman filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))
- Unscented Kalman filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))

Variational Bayesian filters

- Robust Student's t filter ([Huang et al. (2017). A novel robust student's t-based Kalman filter. IEEE TAES.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2651684))
- AX filter ([Lutinnen (2013). Fast variational Bayesian linear state-space model. LNCS](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40988-2_20))

Particle filters

- Particle filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))
- Bootstrap particle filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))
- Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67))
