# Kalman filters

This is a collection of Kalman filters based off of Chapter 5 of Simon Särkkä's book ["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67). It contains:

- Kalman filter

Warning: some filters contain hard-coded model choices.
