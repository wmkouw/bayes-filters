# Bayesian filters

This is a library of Bayesian filters. It currently contains:

- Kalman filter

- Extended Kalman filter 

    - Ref: ["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing (Simon Särkkä)"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67)

- Unscented Kalman filter
