# Bayesian filters

This is a personal archive of implementations of various Bayesian filters. A large part is based on Simon Särkkä's book ["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67) (highly recommended).

Collection contains:

- Kalman filter
- Extended Kalman filter
- Unscented Kalman filter

- Student's t filter
- Robust Student's t filter

- Sequential importance (re)sampling
- Bootstrap particle filter
- Rao-Blackwellized particle filter

Warning: This is not a software package. These implementations are just for me to better understand these algorithms. It may be challenging to apply this code as some filters contain hard-coded model choices.
